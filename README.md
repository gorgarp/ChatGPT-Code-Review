# ChatGPT-Code-Review
Rust application to feed ChatGPT a full cloned repo, and have it review the code.

You will need an OpenAI API Key.

All you need to do is either compile it in Rust or run the latest release. It will prompt you for your API key and where the code you want it to review is locally on your system. All results are printed in console and saved to a file called review.txt.

This is currently only compiled for Windows but should compile fine on Linux.

I welcome PRs or any form of feedback.
